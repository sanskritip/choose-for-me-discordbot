### 👀 Tid-Bits To Know
- ChooseForMe doesn't externally use any database to store the bucket lists and completely relies on the channel message history to maintain the same.
- While making a suggestion/choice ChooseForMe gives you the ```!remove``` to be used to remove that entry from the bucket list. Doing so will help you avoid repetitions :)
